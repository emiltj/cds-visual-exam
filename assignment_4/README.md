<!-- ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION -->
## Assignment description

Create two command-line tools which can be used to perform a simple classification task on the MNIST data and print the output to the terminal. These scripts can then be used to provide easy-to-understand benchmark scores for evaluating these models.
- Include two scripts; one with neural networks and one with logistic regression
- \[BONUS\] Both scripts output a classification report to the terminal and saves it as well
- \[BONUS\] Allow the user to determine number and size of layers for the Neural Network
- \[BONUS\] Allow the user to determine parameters for the Logistic Regression
- \[BONUS\] Allow the user to add an unseen data of any dimensions, process it, and let the classifier classify the new image
- \[BONUS\] Allow the user to save the neural network model for future use

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

Make sure to follow the instructions in the README.md located at the parent level of this repository, for the required installation of the virtual environment as well as the data download.
Subsequently, use the following code:

```bash
cd cds-visual/assignment_2
source ../cv101/bin/activate
python lr_mnist.py
python nn_mnist.py
```

### Optional arguments:

lr_mnist.py arguments for commandline to consider:
-       "-o"
        "--outname",
        type = str,
        default = "classif_report_logistic_regression.csv", # Default when not specifying name of outputfile
        required = False, # Since we have a default value, it is not required to specify this argument
        help = "str - containing name of classification report.")

        "--save", 
        type = bool,
        default = True, # Default when not specifying anything else
        required = False, # Since we have a default value, it is not required to specify this argument
        help = "bool - specifying whether to save classification report.")

        "--penalty", 
        type = str,
        default = "none", # Default when not specifying anything in the terminal

        default = [8, 16], # Default when not specifying anything in the terminal
        required = False, # Since we have a default value, it is not required to specify this argument
        help = "list - specifying the hidden layers, each element in the list corresponds to number of nodes in layer. index in list corresponds to hiddenlayer number. E.g. [8, 16]")
-       "-e"
        "--epochs", 
        type = int,
        default = 50, # Default when not specifying anything in the terminal

        help = "int - specifying number of epochs for training the model. Default = 50")


<!-- METHODS -->
## Methods
**Specifically for this assignment:**

Prior to training, both scripts had the data min-max scaled to allow for faster processing and better convergence. Both the training and test data was scaled using the values of the training data, to avoid information to flow from the training set to the test set.
The user is allowed to specify parameters for both models and the models and the classification reports can be saved if specified using the arguments. These scripts allows for simple model benchmarking on the MNIST dataset, which could prove useful if one wanted to test other models for classification of the same dataset.

Using the "individual" argument, the user can furthermore predict any new images using the model, regardless of size.

**On a more general level (this applies to all assignments):**

I have tried to as accessible and user-friendly as possible. This has been attempted by the use of:
- Smaller functions. These are intended to solve the sub-tasks of the assignment. This is meant to improve readability of the script, as well as simplifying the use of the script.
- Information prints. Information is printed to the terminal to allow the user to know what is being processed in the background
- Argparsing. Arguments that let the user determine the behaviour and paths of the script (see "Optional arguments" section for more information)
