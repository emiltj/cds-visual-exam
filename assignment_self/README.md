<!-- ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION -->
## Assignment description

This self-assigned assignment has two main questions it seeks to investigate.

**Question 1 - Generating stylized paintings**

_Is it possible to use the method of style transfer to stylize paintings of one artist with the style of another?_ 
This assignment seeks to investigate the possibility of not just transferring style from a painting to an actual image, but to transfer the style of a painting to another painting. Using paintings from the artists _Van Gogh_ and _Monet_ using the [impressionist paintings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/delayedkarma/impressionist-classifier-data), create a script which generates new stylized images (contents of Van Gogh with styles of Monet and vice versa).
- Save the stylized images in unique folders with names specifying the stylized images.
- Save images that provide an example of the stylized images. Show a content image, a style image, and the stylized image.

**Question 2 - Classification of stylized images**

_When CNN's classify paintings from artists, do they rely on the style of a given image? Or rather more on the content of the image?_ This part of the assignment seeks to investigate the importance of content vs. style when classifying images.
Train a model (or use a pre-trained model) to classify paintings from two artists. Use this model to

**On a more general level (this applies to all assignments):**

I have tried to as accessible and user-friendly as possible. This has been attempted by the use of:
- Smaller functions. These are intended to solve the sub-tasks of the assignment. This is meant to improve readability of the script, as well as simplifying the use of the script.
- Information prints. Information is printed to the terminal to allow the user to know what is being processed in the background
- Argparsing. Arguments that let the user determine the behaviour and paths of the script (see "Optional arguments" section for more information)
