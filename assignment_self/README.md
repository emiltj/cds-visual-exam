<!-- ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION -->
## Assignment description

This self-assigned assignment has two main questions it seeks to investigate. The investigation is not hypothesis driven nor research oriented. Rather, it is meant to be a fun and atypical way of exploring some methods used in visual analytics.

**Question 1 - Generating stylized paintings**

_Is it possible to use the method of style transfer to stylize paintings of one artist with the style of another?_ 
This assignment seeks to investigate the possibility of not just transferring style from a painting to an actual image, but to transfer the style of a painting to another painting. Using paintings from the artists _Van Gogh_ and _Monet_ using the [impressionist paintings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/delayedkarma/impressionist-classifier-data), create a script which generates new stylized images (contents of Van Gogh with styles of Monet and vice versa).
- Save the stylized images in unique folders with names specifying the stylized images.
- Save images that provide an example of the stylized images. Show a content image, a style image, and the stylized image.

**Question 2 - Classification of stylized images**

_When CNN's classify paintings from artists, do they rely on the style of a given image? Or rather more on the content of the image?_ This part of the assignment seeks to investigate the importance of content vs. style when classifying images. Style transfer refers to the act of minimizing the loss of information between two sets of imbedded images. One image (the style image) is imbedded using the first few layers of a neural network and network activations are sampled from this imbedded image. The other image (the content image) is imbedded using the same neural network, but using the first many layers of the network. Likewise, the network activations of this layer is also sampled. Using these two samples style transfer seeks to synthesize these two imbedded images with the least amount of

## Usage

Make sure to follow the instructions in the README.md located at the parent level of this repository, for the required installation of the virtual environment as well as the data download.
Subsequently, use the following code:

```bash
cd cds-visual/assignment_2
source ../cv101/bin/activate
python cnn-artists.py
```

**On a more general level (this applies to all assignments):**

I have tried to as accessible and user-friendly as possible. This has been attempted by the use of:
- Smaller functions. These are intended to solve the sub-tasks of the assignment. This is meant to improve readability of the script, as well as simplifying the use of the script.
- Information prints. Information is printed to the terminal to allow the user to know what is being processed in the background
- Argparsing. Arguments that let the user determine the behaviour and paths of the script (see "Optional arguments" section for more information)
