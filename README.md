This project contains the exam portofolio coding related to the Spring 2021 module _Visual Analytics_ as part of the bachelor's tilvalg in [_Cultural Data Science_](https://bachelor.au.dk/en/supplementary-subject/culturaldatascience/) at Aarhus University. 
This README contains all the necessary information needed to get an overview of the repository, as well the installation steps required for rerunning the assignments. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started

For running my scripts I'd recommend following the below steps in your bash-terminal. This functions as a setup of the virtual environment, as well as an execution of a bash script that downloads all the data to the data folders respective to the assignments. 

### Cloning repository and creating virtual environment

The below code will clone the repository, as well as create a virtual environment

__MAC/LINUX/WORKER02__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emiltj/cds-visual.git
cd cds-visual
bash ./create_vis_venv.sh
```
__WINDOWS:__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emiltj/cds-visual.git
cd cds-visual
bash ./create_vis_venv_win.sh
```

### Retrieving the data

The data is not contained within this repository, considering the sheer size of the data. Using the provided bash script (```data_download.sh```) that I have created, the data will be downloaded from a Google Drive folder and automatically placed within the respective assignment folders. 

```bash
bash data_download.sh
```

<!-- REPOSITORY STRUCTURE -->
## Repository structure

This repository has the following structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
```assignment_.*/``` | Folders containing the four assignments (both scripts and data)
```utils/``` | Utility functions written by [Ross](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/ross-deans-kristensenmclachlan(29ad140e-0785-4e07-bdc1-8af12f15856c).html). These are sourced in some of the assignments
```data_download.sh``` | Bash script that installs all the necessary data
```create_vis_venv.*.sh``` | Bash scripts that automatically generates a new virtual environment, and install all the packages contained within ```requirements.txt```
```kill_vision_venv.sh``` | Bash scripts that uninstalls and deletes the virtual environment
```requirements.txt``` | A list of packages of certain versions
```README.md``` | This very README file

<!-- ASSIGNMENTS -->
## Assignments

4 assignments have been chosen for this portfolio:
* Assignment 2 - Image search 
* Assignment 4 - Logistic Regression and Neural Network benchmark mnist classification
* Assignment 5 - CNN classification of impressionist paintings
* Self-assigned - * *

**NOTE**:

Information on script execution, preprocessing steps, results and discussion can be seen in the READMEs located within each of the assignment directories.
For seeing information on e.g. the CNN classification of impressionist paintings project, view ```assignment_5/README.md```.
